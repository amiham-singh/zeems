      			<p>I've been collecting mood data for a year now using the App Daylio. While it has helped me learn a lot about my mental health and emotions, I haven't come around to visualizing any of that data. The App as some great viz of its own that helps me view the data for great insights. 
When Happy plot came ups as the theme, I knew I had to visualise my mood data because this year has been a 'happy' year despite all that is happening. So here it is, my Happy plot for 2020. Data till 13 May 2020.
<p>It was hard to settle on a design. I did just a month, then wanted to go 'big picture' but that looked too cluttered. I even tried just doing dot plots of the smiley faces but that didn't say much. I think this version could defiantly use improvements but I wanted it to feel overwhelming and that's why the text is big and out of proportion. </p></p>

How we should aspire to protect them, preserve them, work towards nurturing and growing these spaces. Lots of happy plots</p> </p>

      			<p>This week I knew I wanted to edit a personal picture. 
Going through my camera roll I found this image from a few years ago and felt it describes how I am currently feeling.  Been in the house for 5 weeks now and the lack of human contact is making feel like I'm free-falling.
</p><p>There is something all-consuming and sensual about water. It's the perfect metaphor for desire. Here it is outside my window, right there to touch but I can't go out for a dip. </p>

        	<p>Every time I looked at the trees out of my window, I imagined them to be underwater plants on the sea bed. And birds chilling atop them. Such a powerful visual, I thought. It could mean so many things. Climate change even! It's a whimsical imagery, that tells me, hey now I have nowhere to go, but stay put. Stay home. I can powerlessly gaze out of the window, but i dare not step out. It's too late. </p><p>
I have been itching to animate! I have a deep, deep fear of animation. It's amusing 'coz I'm an animation film graduate. But I see myself as a lost cause. For this one, I attempted animation after 2 years and on Photoshop for the first time. Eventhough it was just a couple of frames of bubbles, I cannot begin to explain how liberating it was! I am already inspired and want to animate more! Make more bad animation! But make! Put them out!  </p>

      			<p><p>For this week I wanted to do another data art piece. Initially, I was going to visualize marijuana legalisation per country but something didn't seem right. I moved to Canada in the middle of winter and when I landed, there was no grass. I knew I had to make something around that physical shift. I had boarded a plane in New Delhi, a city lush with greenery and landed in Canada, a country where all the trees were covered in snow.</p><p> I think this piece is pretty cool because if you turn it upside down it says one thing and when you flip it says another, but the tree remains the same, somewhat like my journey around the world. </p></p>

        	<p>I had not used Google keep to sketch in a long time. So just as a fun warm up, I decided draw this prompt on Keep. After a long hiatus and brief depressive period, I mustered up the courage to draw. And what I thought would be the most daunting task, something that I was keeping out of sight (but not out of mind) turned out to be oddly liberating. Trust drawing and especially on Google Keep to make me feel better instantly. 


</p><p>My first impression of the words 'no grass' is an alternate world that looks nothing like ours. The skies also look sort of ominous and dreary. Grass represents life, freshness, hope. And no grass represents a strangely dull, bleak, repititive landscape. 

</p><p>Once I picked up some momentum, I went ahead and made another interpretation of no grass.</p> </p>

      			<p>After stumbling upon  <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/monachalabi/?hl=en" >Mona Chalabi</a> on Instagram, I have been fascinated with data art. I took the chance with "Most dry" to explore some of that on my own. 
So I set out looking for data to present dryness/ wetness and I  found <a href = "https://data.gov.in/catalog/rainfall-india?filters%5Bfield_catalog_reference%5D=1090541&format=json&offset=0&limit=6&sort%5Bcreated%5D=desc">rainfall data in India</a>. Because this was a quick turnaround piece I didn't add more datasets as dimensions to the piece. 
</p><p> Each coloured drop represents a month from the legend. The heavier the drop ( the closer it is to the ground) the more rainfall that month. The intensity of rain shafts represents the annual rainfall that year. The darker the shaft, the more rainfall that year.  2009 was the "most dry" year from the data set. </p><p> To get the basic positions of the drops, I charted a dot plot from the data. I then flipped it ( to get the heavier dots closer to the bottom)  and drew drops on the positions of the dots. </p>

                <p>For this week's theme, I didn't want to make a literal visual about a shadow falling. Though I did sketch out a few of those possibilities.  </p>
<p> For this piece, I was looking through Unsplash images for inspiration and came across the picture of the stairs going down. Looking at the picture, I felt like I was falling too. That's when I knew that I needed to make something out of it. I added the foliage at the end of the stairs because they would cast a good shadow on the red carpet. </p>

The only memory I have of that time and place was staring at this giant shadow of the musician falling on one of the wings of the stage. I was watching his shadow play. Such an evocative visual that needed to be sketched out.</p><p> Been meaning to dabble around with collage for the longest time. Added a starry sky cutout here just for the feels. </p>

We first met while covering the 2019 general elections in India for the BBC in New Delhi. After learning about our shared appreciation for art and design we started collaborating weekly to keep our creative juices flowing.  We would write down random words on paper and pick two from the ever-growing bunch every week. We'd then create art pieces around the "Theme of the week" and showcase them to each other. 
As our contracts with the BBC ended and we moved on to different jobs this personal collaborative project also took on different forms. 
The latest is what you see on this web page.</p>
<p>
Now instead of picking the theme from a set of chits, we have a python script do it for us. The code takes two words at random from a google sheet that we regularly update with words and phrases and creates a theme.
