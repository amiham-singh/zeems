# Repo for the colaborative art project "Nothing is as it zeems" 
https://amiham-singh.github.io/zeems/

An art collaboration between Mahima Singh and Zeel Sanghvi

Every week a python script produces a randomly generated theme that we visualise individually. We are free to interpret the theme as we like and present it how we want, leaving room for experimentation and creativity. We also included writeups with our designs explaining our thought process.
